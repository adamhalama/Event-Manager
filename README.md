Company event management app
Group project for the second semester

This system made for a fictional company allows them to manage events which is useful for preventing double-booking of rooms, adding online events and of course the system allows employees with specific roles to manage the user accounts and the rooms. The system also has a chat system linked to the events. It is a multi-user, server-client desktop application with a log in system managing user permissions based on the roles in the company.

This project was designed as a Client-Server system, and was developed using the Scrum development framework, with Java, JavaFX and PostgreSQL.
