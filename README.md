# BruhProject
Company event management app
Group project for the second semester

Desktop application used to track company event, conference rooms and employees. The employees could chat in chat rooms, either created manually or those that are automatically created with each events. Conference rooms have schedules for people that want to use them, so they can see when they are available for meetings/conferences. The event, if created in a conference room, has to not overlap with any other event in that room, but events can also be created as online events.

This project was designed as a Client-Server system, and was developed using the Scrum development framework, with Java, JavaFX and PostgreSQL.
